- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thieu-strongpaw
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more advanced coding using the python language so I can start a career that challenges my mind.
- ðŸŒ± I have been learning HTML and CSS mostly because I would like to start my own blog but also to better understand the way the web works. 
- ðŸŒ± I've also now started with C++. A class I took had all examples in Python and C++ and my curiosity got me. Now I'm studying Python in school and C++ on my own.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me strongpawcoding@gmail.com is the best way to find me.
