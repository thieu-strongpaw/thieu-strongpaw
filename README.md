- 👋 Hi, I’m @thieu-strongpaw
- 👀 I’m interested in just learning the basics of coding using the python language so I can start a career that challenges my mind.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analysis on freecodecamp.org but every day I make it a point to learn at least one thing, no matter how small.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing yet
- 📫 How to reach me strongpawcoding@gmail.com is the best way to find me.
