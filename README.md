- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thieu-strongpaw
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in just learning the basics of coding using the python language so I can start a career that challenges my mind.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis on freecodecamp.org but every day I make it a point to learn at least one thing, no matter how small.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me strongpawcoding@gmail.com is the best way to find me.

- Today I am going to dump a lot of the projects that I have been working on and learning from in anticipation of potential job opportunities. It dawned on me just this morning that this is the best way to show off some accomplishments, even if they are not perfect or finished. Rome, after all, was not built in a day.
